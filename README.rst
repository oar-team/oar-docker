oar-docker is a set of docker images especially configured for deploying
your own OAR cluster. The main idea is to have a mini development cluster with
a frontend, a server and some nodes that launch in just a few seconds on a
simple laptop.


Why use oar-docker?
-------------------

Various case scenarios may affect you:
 - Quickly test OAR on a cluster
 - Gain time: a ten-node cluster (or more) is launched in just a
   few seconds and is cleaned in less than a second.
 - Save resources: docker allows the user to pool the node between
   various systems, resource utilization is thus considerably reduced.
 - Synced volume : allowing you to continue working on your host machine, but
   use the resources in the guest machine to compile or run your project.


Installation
------------

Requirements:
  - python >= 2.7
  - docker >= 1.3
  - cgroup v1

You can install, upgrade, uninstall oar-docker with these commands::

  $ pip install [--user] oar-docker
  $ pip install [--user] --upgrade oar-docker
  $ pip uninstall oar-docker

Or from git (last development version)::

  $ pip install git+https://github.com/oar-team/oar-docker.git

Or if you already pulled the sources::

  $ pip install path/to/sources

Using a virtualenv may help overcome issues between python and your distribution.

Getting started
---------------

To get started with oar-docker, the first thing to do is to initialize a
project::

    $ oardocker init

If you already have OAR sources, the best is to initialize directly the
oardocker project in the OAR sources directory::

    $ cd path/to/oar/src
    $ oardocker init

You have to do this only once. It allows you to import the Dockerfiles
and other configuration files.

We then launch the base image build::

    $ oardocker build

Now, we have to install OAR. To do this, several options are available.

If you already have the OAR sources::

    $ oardocker install /path/to/oar_src

Or if you want to install from tarball::

    $ oardocker install http://oar-ftp.imag.fr/oar/2.5/sources/testing/oar-2.5.4+rc4.tar.gz

You can also launch the installation from a git repository::

    $ oardocker install git+https://github.com/oar-team/oar.git

We start a OAR cluster with 5 nodes::

    $ oardocker start -n 5

It is possible to share directories between host machines and
all containers with the ``-v`` option::

    $ oardocker start -v $PWD:/oar_src -v /my/custom/lib:/usr/local/ma_lib

To manage the cluster::

    $ oardocker connect frontend|server|nodeXX
    $ oardocker logs [frontend|server|nodeXX]

To clean::

    $ oardocker stop  # stops and removes all containers
    $ oardocker clean  # removes all stopped containers (failed) and the untagged images <none:none>
    $ oardocker destroy  # removes all images and containers

With oar-docker, it is possible to chain all commands to go faster::

    $ oardocker init -f build install oar-2.5.4+rc4.tar.gz start -n 4 connect -l root frontend

For instance, to develop on OAR, we often need to install OAR,
start the cluster and connect to it::

    $ oardocker install $PWD start -n 10 -v $PWD:/home/docker/oar_src connect frontend

One last thing to know. The ``stop`` command is automatically launched before
every ``start``, ``install`` and ``build`` ... If we launch multiple times the
last command, we will always obtain the same result. It can be useful to
experiment and develop (even) faster.

Note for OAR < 2.5.9+g5k5
-------------------------

oardocker â‰¥ 1.6.0 does not create the ``/dev/oar_cgroups_links/`` and ``/dev/cpuset`` in ``oardocker install``, to let OAR take care of it so that the concerned part of ``job_resource_manager_cgroup.pl`` is actually tested.

This breaks ``job_resource_manager_cgroup.pl`` before OAR 2.5.9+g5k5. See ``.oardocker/init-scripts/prepare_oar_cgroup.sh`` to revert to the old behaviour, by setting::

    CREATE_OAR_CGROUPS_LINKS=yes

The oardocker on Debian setup
-----------------------------
To use oardocker on a Debian 11 (bullseye) system, one must activate Linux cgroup v1. This can be achieved by including in the linux kernel cmdline: `systemd.legacy_systemd_cgroup_controller=true` (add those options to your bootloader configuration).

Using a python3 venv
--------------------
oardocker can be installed in a python3 venv::

  $ python3 -m venv oardocker
  $ cd oardocker
  $ . bin/activate
  $ pip install oar-docker
  $ oardocker init -e bullseye
  $ oardocker build
  $ oardocker install path/to/oar/git/repository
  $ oardocker start
  $ oardocker connect
  $ ...

Network services
----------------

By default, oardocker forwards the 80 and 6667 TCP ports to the frontend
container, for the OAR web services. To add other TCP ports forwarding to
the frontend, modify the ``.oardocker/manifest.json`` file, adding extra lines
in the ``net_services`` array. For instance::

    "network_services": [
        ["Netcat", " (tcp test)", "5000", "TCP: "],
        ["Secure web service", "/secure", "443", "https://"],
        ["Python API", "/newoarapi", "6668"],
        ...
    ]

Which translates to the following forwardings::

    ******************** Network Services *********************
    
                  Netcat: TCP: localhost:45000 (tcp test)
      Secure web service: https://localhost:40443/secure
              Python API: http://localhost:46668/newoarapi
                     ...
    ***********************************************************

Only the numerical port numbers really matters, texts are only informative.

Security
--------

oar-docker is a development project and a testing one. It is in no way secure.
Besides, the private ssh key used is also insecured since it is public (you can
find it in the sources).
